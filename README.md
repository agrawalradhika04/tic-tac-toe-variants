# tic-tac-toe-variants
This project features two terminal-based implementations of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, showcasing both the standard 3×3 version and a 4×4 expanded variant. Each version handles input validation, win condition checks, game progression, and allows players to replay rounds. The code in each file is self-contained and designed for a two-player console experience.

ttt_simple.cpp : Implements a 3×3 terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. It features a visual grid display, input validation, alternating turns between X and O, and win detection across all 8 possible winning conditions (3 rows, 3 columns, 2 diagonals). After each game, players are prompted to play another round.

ttt_adv.cpp : Implements a 4×4 version of Tic-Tac-Toe using a 2D vector. The game includes move validation, alternating turns, and win detection by checking for fully filled rows and columns with the same marker. It provides a clean board display and allows repeated playthroughs.
